            <p>The Pacific Northwest is a charmer and its offbeat character and quirky sense of humor make it fun to be around and hard to say goodbye to. Welcome to the Pacific Northwest, a fresh and captivating corner of North America, where Nature gives us a glimpse at her incomprehensible range. Here, a fusion of vastly different topographies comes together in one unlikely painting: endless stretches of windswept, sandy beaches; dense expanses of sylvan forest; great crashing rivers; dramatic river valleys; gently rolling hills covered in neat rows of vines; the portentous presence of towering, snow-capped volcanoes; and vast high deserts of sagebrush and juniper. This is a place where Nature reigns, a place where man still treads with a reverent step. </p>

            <h3>Pack Accordingly</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most important thing to keep in mind when trekking across Cascadia is to pack accordingly. We have peaks that are snowy almost year round, while at the bottom of that mountain it may be 95 degrees. You could be hiking in teh most beautiful backcountry in the world, wowing at the waterfalls, and at a live show seeing your favorite band hours later. Then the next day you could be on the coast watching whales.

                <li>Be free while you're here i.e., don't over plan </li>
                <li>Shop and eat local. Because fuck chains.</li>
                <li>Pack lightly so you're agile with travel plans.</li>
