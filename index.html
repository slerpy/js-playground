        <p>The Pacific Northwest is a charmer and its offbeat character and quirky sense of humor make it fun to be around and hard to say goodbye to. Welcome to the Pacific Northwest, a fresh and captivating corner of North America, where Nature gives us a glimpse at her incomprehensible range. Here, a fusion of vastly different topographies comes together in one unlikely painting: endless stretches of windswept, sandy beaches; dense expanses of sylvan forest; great crashing rivers; dramatic river valleys; gently rolling hills covered in neat rows of vines; the portentous presence of towering, snow-capped volcanoes; and vast high deserts of sagebrush and juniper. This is a place where Nature reigns, a place where man still treads with a reverent step. </p>
